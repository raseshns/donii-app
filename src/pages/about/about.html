    <h4>Angie Janssen  <br> Founder and CEO</h4>
  
<div>  In 2015 Angie wanted to give her barely used guest room bed to someone she imagined could really use it: a family moving out of a shelter and into permanent housing, or the parents of a foster child finally outgrowing his toddler cot.  <br> <br> Imagining the family was easier than finding it.  Despite knowing that a struggling family in her vicinity would undoubtedly love to give a new bed a warm homecoming, it eventually went on craigslist â€“ a casualty of the inability of those who are able to give and those who are willing to receive to communicate. <br> <br> Donii was born of the belief that generosity combined with connectivity can meaningfully alleviate material need. Angie earned degrees in Government and Urban Planning from Harvard University.  <br> <br><b>She believes in making cities smarter by building more efficient social mechanisms.</b> </div>
