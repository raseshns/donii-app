    <h3>Donii Profiled for WGBH TV Segment "Greater Bostonians    </h3>
	<p>
      When a local woman discovered that donations don’t always go to people in the greatest need, she developed a new way to give. It was shortly after the birth of her daughter that Angie Janssen discovered an odd truth:  life with small children can lead to the accumulation of large amounts of stuff.   Her older son was a toddler and between them the kids had more toddler gear than they could use.  She started giving away the extras.

<h3> Do You Want to Know What Really Happens to the Stuff You Donate?</h3>
    <p>
      For many of us, donating is the most socially conscious way to offload the things we no longer need. You don’t want to throw away that perfectly good sweater you never really loved, or the baby toys your toddler doesn’t play with anymore. The best thing would be to give them away… right?
