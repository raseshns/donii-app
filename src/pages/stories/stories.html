    Amy S. at Microsoft New England <br>Donated Kitchen Supplies
  </ion-card-header>
  <ion-card-content>
This donation was given to a single mother of two young daughters who became homeless after ending an abusive domestic situation. The sudden loss of household income caused her to fall behind on rent, leading to her eviction. The mom turned to FamilyAid Boston, a nonprofit on Donii's platform. She was accepted into their Rapid Re-Housing program and was able to move into a new apartment with her girls.  She is working with her social worker to maintain a budget, which does not allow for many household items. This generous donation of kitchen supplies was a much needed addition to her new home.  </ion-card-content>

Part of this donation was given to a single mother of an eight year-old son, working two jobs to provide a stable home for her family. She found herself homeless when she was forced to move out of her apartment due to a substantial rental increase. As the primary caregiver for her son and with no support services in place, she feared losing everything she worked so hard to accomplish. She and her son were placed in FamilyAid Boston’s emergency shelter program and soon found an apartment. The donation of good quality clothing has given her the confidence to seek a higher paying job, and she has said she now feels there is hope for her family’s future.</ion-card-content>

A single mother and her two young sons were living in a motel with no kitchen and only a microwave. With the help of her social worker, the mother was able to get a better job and eventually move out of shelter into her own apartment. One of her greatest joys is cooking healthy meals for her two young boys. The gift of the new dining set made this possible and helped her new apartment feel like a home.    </ion-card-content>
